# Configraphix
Configragpics is an emblematic name for "graph theoretical methods for design and analysis of spatial configurations"; that is the title of my PhD dissertation.

The dissertation is available as pdf (free of charge) [here](http://abe.tudelft.nl/index.php/faculty-architecture/issue/archive)

Hard copies are also available [via Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Configraphics-Theoretical-Methods-Analysis-Configurations/dp/9461867204)

I have partially published the tools introduced in my PhD in two separate packages: [SYNTACTIC](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/space-syntax) & [CONFIGURBANIST](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/cheetah). The idea is to put the two together in one package for design and analysis at various scales of built environments.
