Configraphix is a library of tools for computational design and analysis of spatial configurations using networks and fields. We have partially published the tools introduced in three separate packages: [SYNTACTIC](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/space-syntax) & [CONFIGURBANIST](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/cheetah) and [RasterWorks](https://github.com/Pirouz-Nourian/Topological_Rasterization). The idea is to put the three together in one open-source package for design and analysis at various scales of built environments. The features of this library [will] include the features of these three libraries and more:

* Computational Graph-Based Layout (extending/integrating [SYNTACTIC](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/space-syntax))
* Spatial Network Analysis Methods (extending/integrating [CONFIGURBANIST](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/cheetah))
* Computational Field-Based Layout Methods (extending/integrating [RasterWorks](https://github.com/Pirouz-Nourian/Topological_Rasterization))
* Agnet-Based Layout Methods: using [topoGenesis](https://github.com/shervinazadi/topoGenesis)

Configragpics is an emblematic name for "Graph Theoretical Methods for Design and Analysis of Spatial Configurations"; that is the title of a PhD dissertation by Pirouz Nourian.

The dissertation is available as pdf (free of charge) [here](http://abe.tudelft.nl/index.php/faculty-architecture/issue/archive)

Hard copies are also available [via Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Configraphics-Theoretical-Methods-Analysis-Configurations/dp/9461867204)
